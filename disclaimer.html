  <h1>Disclaimer & Important Policy Notice</h1>
  <p>Serorome Valley Ventures • Policies & Terms 2025–2026</p>
</header>

<div class="content">

  <h2>1. General Travel Service Disclaimers</h2>
  <p>Serorome Valley Ventures acts as a premium travel coordinator and agent for independent third-party service providers across the SADC region. These may include hotels, lodges, transportation companies, guides, and activity operators. While we carefully select and vet our partners, we are not directly liable for loss, damage, injury, delays, cancellations, or omissions caused by these third-party providers. All services are governed by the terms and conditions of the respective providers.</p>
  <p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Clients are strongly advised to secure comprehensive travel, medical, baggage, and cancellation insurance at the time of booking.</p>

  <h2>2. The Role of Your Travel Co-ordinator</h2>
  <p>Your dedicated Co-ordinator will design, manage, and oversee your journey with professionalism and care. They operate within a set mandate and cannot commit to arrangements or upgrades outside the confirmed booking agreement unless approved and documented.</p>

  <h2>3. Protection of Personal Information (POPI Act)</h2>
  <p>We adhere strictly to South Africa’s POPI Act. All personal and financial information is protected and processed lawfully and used only for the purposes of arranging and securing your travel, accommodations, and activities.</p>

  <h2>4. Pricing, Deposits & Service Tier Policy</h2>
  <p>All Serorome Valley Ventures travel packages are custom-built and priced dynamically according to season, destination availability, accommodation type, and chosen service tier.</p>

  <h3>Deposit Requirement (Mandatory)</h3>
  <p>A <strong>50% deposit</strong> of the total package cost is required to secure any booking.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Example: If your trip costs <strong>$10,000</strong>, a deposit of <strong>$5,000</strong> is required.</li>
    <li>This deposit confirms your accommodation, transport, guides, and activity availability.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Final Payment Policy</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Final balance is due <strong>5 days before departure</strong> for all packages booked 6 or more weeks in advance.</li>
    <li>Late payment may result in cancellation of services without refund of the deposit.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Reservations & Confirmation Rules</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>All reservations must be confirmed in writing via e-mail.</li>
    <li>Once confirmation is sent and acknowledged, cancellation terms apply.</li>
    <li>Special dietary requirements must be submitted at least <strong>30 days</strong> prior to arrival.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Provisional Booking Timeline</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Travel within 3 months:</strong> Booking held provisionally for 2 weeks.</li>
    <li><strong>Travel beyond 3 months:</strong> Booking held provisionally for 1 month.</li>
    <li>If another client requests the same dates, you will be notified and given <strong>5 working days</strong> to confirm with deposit. Failure results in automatic cancellation.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Group Cancellation Policy (Important)</h2>
  <p>This policy applies to groups, families, tour parties, and corporate or school travel bookings.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>90–76 days prior to arrival:</strong> 20% of the total invoice is payable.</li>
    <li><strong>75–60 days prior to arrival:</strong> 50% of the total invoice is payable.</li>
    <li><strong>60 days or less prior to arrival:</strong> 90% of the total invoice is payable.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>These cancellation fees are necessary to cover accommodation, transport blocking, third-party penalties, and operational costs already incurred by Serorome Valley Ventures.</p>

  <h2>7. Dynamic Pricing Disclaimer</h2>
  <p>Prices may fluctuate due to external events such as major sporting events, political gatherings, extreme weather, local festivals, or supplier price changes. We commit to notifying clients immediately of any unavoidable adjustments.</p>
