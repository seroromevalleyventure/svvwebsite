    <h2>Disclaimer & Important Policy Notice</h2>
    <p><em>Important information regarding our travel services, coordinator responsibilities, and data protection policies.</em></p>

    <h3>1. General Travel Service Disclaimers</h3>
    <p>Serorome Valley Ventures acts as a premium travel coordinator and agent for independent third-party service providers, including but not limited to hotels, lodges, transportation companies, and local activity operators.</p>

    <p><strong>Accommodation, Food & Transportation:</strong></p>
    <p>While we meticulously select and vet our partners for quality and safety, Serorome Valley Ventures is not directly liable for any loss, damage, injury, delay, or additional expense arising from any act, omission, or negligence of these independent third-party suppliers (e.g., in the event of unforeseen changes to flight schedules, food quality issues, or hotel facility problems). All services are subject to the terms and conditions of the specific third-party provider.</p>

    <p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Clients are strongly advised to secure comprehensive travel insurance at the time of booking to cover potential risks, including but not limited to, medical emergencies, cancellations, delays, personal injury, and loss of property.</p>

    <h3>2. The Role of Your Travel Co-ordinator</h3>
    <p>Your dedicated Travel Co-ordinator is committed to designing and managing your journey with the highest level of professionalism and care.</p>

    <p><strong>Focus on Client Needs:</strong> The Co-ordinator works diligently to meet your travel requirements, taking into account reasonableness, client needs, and your pre-agreed budget. Any requests falling outside the confirmed itinerary or scope of service will be handled on a best-effort basis and may incur additional, pre-approved costs.</p>

    <p><strong>Limitation of Authority:</strong> The Travel Co-ordinator acts on behalf of Serorome Valley Ventures and has defined authority. They are not authorized to make commitments or incur liabilities outside the scope of your confirmed booking agreement.</p>

    <h3>3. Protection of Personal Information (POPI Act Compliance)</h3>
    <p>In adherence to the South African Protection of Personal Information Act (POPI Act), Serorome Valley Ventures is committed to protecting the privacy and security of your personal data.</p>

    <p><strong>Bank Details and Financial Information:</strong> We treat your sensitive financial information with the utmost security. Serorome Valley Ventures will not request or accept your bank account details (including account number, card numbers, or PINs) via unsecure methods like text message or through initial website forms.</p>

    <p><strong>Established Communication Channels:</strong> We will only request the necessary financial or banking information required for processing payments and finalizing your booking once a clear client-business interest has been established and confirmed through official email correspondence and/or secure WhatsApp communication from the official numbers listed on our "Contact" page.</p>

    <p><strong>Data Usage:</strong> Any personal information collected is processed lawfully, only for the purposes necessary to coordinate and execute your premium travel journey (e.g., booking flights, accommodation, and securing necessary permits) and will not be shared with unauthorized third parties.</p>

    <h3>4. Pricing and Service Tier Notice</h3>
    <p>To ensure our premium travel services perfectly align with your expectations and budget, we employ a dynamic, client-centric tier system. Please note the following regarding our pricing structure and negotiation process:</p>

    <p><strong>Customised Tier System:</strong> Serorome Valley Ventures caters to a broad range of traveler needs, from Backpacker requirements to 5-Star Luxury Hotel client expectations. This means every journey is uniquely crafted and priced based on your chosen level of accommodation, security, transport, and inclusions.</p>

    <p><strong>No Fixed US Dollar Pricing:</strong> Due to the highly customized nature of our services and the variation in costs across different service tiers (e.g., specific lodges, luxury vehicle choices, private security detail levels), we do not publish a fixed price in US Dollars or any other currency.</p>

    <p><strong>Negotiation and Budget Alignment:</strong> All sales and final pricing are determined through a dedicated consultation and negotiation process. We discuss the cost of your journey within reason and take into account the peak/off-peak travel season for the relevant destinations (Botswana, Zambia, Zimbabwe). This ensures the quoted price accurately reflects the level of service and the current cost of ground services at the time of booking.</p>

    <p><strong>Booking Finalisation:</strong> A final, agreed-upon price will be confirmed in a detailed quote after the itinerary, service tier, and budget have been mutually discussed and accepted.</p>

    <h3>5. 🌍 Custom & Optional Travel Packages</h3>
    <p>Serorome Valley Ventures is committed to crafting your perfect Southern African experience. We are open to arranging and coordinating travel to other Southern African destinations outside of our standard packaged tours.</p>

    <p><strong>Your Journey, Your Choice:</strong> Clients are responsible for providing detailed information on the specific destination(s) they would like to visit at any given time of the year. Our Travel Co-ordinators will then assess the request and design a secure, custom itinerary for you.</p>

    <h4>Dynamic Pricing Disclaimer</h4>
    <p>Please be advised that all quotes for custom and standard packages are subject to potential price fluctuations throughout the year.</p>

    <p><strong>Fluctuations Due to Rare Events:</strong> Prices may change due to rare or unforeseen events beyond Serorome Valley Ventures' control. These events include, but are not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Major sporting events (e.g., international tournaments)</li>
      <li>Severe and unusual weather conditions</li>
      <li>Large political or social gatherings</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We will always communicate any anticipated or unavoidable price adjustments to the client as soon as possible.</p>

    <p><em>By proceeding with our services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to the terms outlined above.</em></p>

    <p>For questions regarding these policies, please contact our team through the official channels listed in our Contact section.</p>
